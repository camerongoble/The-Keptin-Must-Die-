# The Keptin Must Die!
Only the most ruthless, imaginative, and power-mad sadists in the galaxy have what it takes to seize command of an Imperial Star Ship.  So you have *that* going for you.  Even if you are just an Ensign.  For now.

__The Keptin Must Die!__ is a solo journalling game you play along with a game of standard Solitaire.  As you lay out the cards, you'll scheme, bribe, and conspire to assassinate The Keptin and rise in the ranks.  If you think your plan is good enough, go for it!  Or bide your time and savor the thrill of the hunt.

Wealth, power, prestige, sex... it can all be *yours*!

But first, The Keptin must die!

## Materials
To play, you'll need:
* A deck of 52 cards, jokers removed
* 2 six-sided dice
* A notebook or other journalling medium
* A viscious streak waiting to be indulged

That's it!

## Setting Up
Begin by shuffling the deck.

Now find a Benefactor.  Do this by pulling the top card.  (As an Ensign, you may only pull one card when looking for a Benefactor.  As you rise in rank, more cards become available.)

This will be your Benefactor, the person who inspired you to kill The Keptin in the first place, provided you access to resources, and put you on the path to glory in the Imperial Fleet.  Card in hand, consult the following tables:

| Card Value | Your Benefactor                                    |
|:----------:| -------------------------------------------------- |
|  Ace (1)   | You, yourself, by your bootstraps                  |
|     2      | Your second cousin on your mother's side           |
|     3      | Your humiliated parent                             |
|     4      | Your best friend from the Imperial Academy         |
|     5      | A zealot who seems to know the future              |
|     6      | An influencial "businessman" in the sector         |
|     7      | A rival Captain from their old days at the Academy |
|     8      | The military governor of a planet                  |
|     9      | An attache to an Imperial Senator                  |
|     10     | A family member attached to a major house          |
| Jack (10)  | Lord or Lady of a major house                      |
| Queen (10) | The Emperor's personal consort                     |
| King (11)  | The Emperor's private secretary                    |

| Card Suit | Your Benefactor's Motive               |
|:---------:| -------------------------------------- |
|  Hearts   | Betrayal of a personal relationship    |
|   Clubs   | Brooking favor with the powers that be |
| Diamonds  | Reneging on a business deal            |
|  Spades   | Avenging a death at The Keptin's hands  |

Open your journal to a new page and make note of your benefactor and their motive in helping you.  This is the first page in your **Book of Plots**.  Your benefactor will play a crucial role in deciding whether a plot is worth trying, or whether you should go back to the drawing board.

Put all the cards back in the deck (no jokers!) and re-shuffle.

You're ready to play.

But first, it might help to know what's at stake.

## Building Your Plot: The Game of Solitaire

Deal out and play a game of Solitaire.  Refresher rules are included at the end of this document.  Play until the Solitaire rules indicate you are done.

You *must* make any available move you see on the field before the game concludes.  If you discover that you missed a legitimate move because you didn't see it, that's okay--just don't deliberately ignore a move that might otherwise hamper you.  It is your duty to the Empire!

Keep in mind that **the order in which you make those moves** is up to you.  Pay attention to your options and plan carefully.

Your strategy is twofold:
* build the most powerful chains of cards you can in the field *without* having the King involved
* move as many cards to the Ace stacks as you can

A chain is only as powerful as its highest value card.  But if The Keptin (represented by a King) sees you getting too powerful, everything you've done will go under the Keptin's control.  But that can be useful too...

### When a King Enters Play
A King in play represents The Keptin's heightened paranoia as you scheme.  Play any Kings as normal according to the solitaire rules.  Any stacks moved to a King fall under The Keptin's control, and you cannot use them in your plot.

You *must* play eligible stacks onto King cards as per the Solitaire rules.  Similarly, you *must* move a King to an eligible empty slot.  The Keptin is in charge of the ship (for now) and will not be denied.

A short stack under The Keptin deprives you of very powerful cards!  However, longer stacks are more unwieldy and actually take power away from The Keptin.


## A Conspiracy of One

The Solitaire game represents your patient-but-opportunistic gathering of forces to take The Keptin down.  Perhaps The Keptin--being a paranoid bastard who is always supicious of everybody--suspects that something is up, but nothing leads to you directly.  Yet.

You must now put them together into a workable plan.  Refer to **What the Cards Mean** above and work out the details in your **Book of Plots**.  Be as brief or verbose as it takes.  Draw diagrams.  Cross out bits that don't work or need improving.  Doodle.  Some plots may inspire you more than others.  Imagine really sticking it to that arrogant  Indulge yourself.

### Nice Plot.  But Will It Work?

Up until now, your treacherous scheming has all been safely tucked away in your imagination.  Now you have to decide whether it's safe to act.

And that means rolling the dice.  Risky, to say the least.

If The Keptin survives, you will definitely be found out, tortured, killed, and thrown off the ship... possibly even in that order.  Are the odds really in your favor?

Let's find out.

### Sweeping the Field

The only victory better than winning by luck is to win by turning The Keptin's own plans overwhelmingly against them.

If every card on the field has ended up in your Ace stacks, including all the Kings, then you have truly shown your mettle!  Don't it feel good?  Word of your remarkable ascension may even reach the ears of the Imperial Court.

So!  Not only do you get your promotion as expected, but you may draw a one-time-only extra card when choosing your next Benefactor.  More choices, more power.  Just this once.

## So Now You're The Keptin
Special rules apply to being The Keptin.  That's why you want to be The Keptin, of course!
* Every conspiracy against you must be dealt with.  The opposing Ensign does not choose whether to go against you or not.  Every Solitaire game represents a challenge you must meet head on.
* The Keptin does *not* roll the dice during scoring, unless the Ensign's final score is greater than the Keptin's.  This is just like when you were the Ensign.  Similarly, the Ensign *does* roll the dice to contribute luck to their final score.
* When a conspiracy begins, the opposing Ensign draws a Benefactor card as usual, and its value applies to their final score accordingly.
* You do **not** draw a Benefactor upon assuming the Captain's rank...
* ... unless you Sweep the Field (see rules above).  If so, you can draw a Benefactor, use them according to the normal rules on your behalf, and keep them from game to game.  And if you Sweep the Field *again*, you can opt to draw another Benefactor to replace the one you have.  _Plus_ you can choose between the one you already have and the one you just drew.  Hey, it's good to be The Keptin!
* When you win, you remain The Keptin and do *not* promote in rank.  As Keptin, your goal is to fend off ambitious underlings for as long as you can.
* When you lose, you are executed and lose everything.  Just like you forced onto The Keptin when *they* lost.
* Your Book of Plots is now the Keptin's Log.  Describe your underling's pathetic schemes to overthrow you, and how you easily crushed them.  Punish any of their allies if you feel like it will make an impression.  The crew must be kept in line.
As you maintain your Keptin's log, you may discover patterns forming.  Can you _really_ trust that Transporter Chief who came over to your side at the last minute?  Did your personal food taster really just "happen" to come down with the Altairian flu before lunch?  And the Navigator is looking awfully smug lately...

Write it all down.  Keep track.  No detail is too small to crack a potential conspiracy wide open.  Perhaps The Keptin wasn't so paranoid after all...
