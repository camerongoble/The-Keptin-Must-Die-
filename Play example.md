## Ensign's Personal log

_Pulled a Spade for my motive._

The Keptin is personally responsible for my family's sorrow.  I feel fully justified in paying him back in kind.  For my family's honor and the good of the Empire, the Keptin must die!

_Pulled the Ace of Diamonds as my first Benefactor._

I have used all my personal funds to travel to Fleet Command, enlist, and bribe my way into being assigned to the Keptin's ship.  Now that I am in place, I must work out a plan.

### Plan A:
|        | Hand                                          | value |
| ------ | --------------------------------------------- | ----- |
| Keptin | 10 clubs, 10 diamonds, 10 hearts, Jack spades | 40    |
| Me:    | 9 clubs                                       | 9     |

I heard there is an experimental virus on board, but could not figure out a way to expose the Keptin to it.  Not worth even trying.  What would I do, just fling it at him, hold my breath, and run?  Need a better plan.

### Plan B:
|        | Hand                                         | value |
| ------ | -------------------------------------------- | ----- |
| Keptin | 4 clubs, 10 diamonds, 8 hearts, 10 spades    | 32    |
| Me:    | 2 clubs, 10 diamonds, Queen hearts, 4 spades | 27    |

This is more like it!  I can promise the Keptin's consort I could liberate her sister from the mining prison on Kodos VI.  In return, she can arrange for the Keptin to be alone on the Observation Deck.  Then I will simply beat him to death with an Polluxian Battle Cudgel!  I can't wait to see the look on his face.

_Rolls the die, needs greater than 5, gets a 10_

The Keptin's unfortunate pulp was found in a ventilation shaft by the afternoon shift.  The Executive Officer is now Keptin, with a corresponding promotion in rank for everyone.

## Lieutenant's Personal Log

_Pulled Jack of Clubs as new Benefactor_

Lord Pike has approached me with an intriguing offer: he will see that certain career opportunities come my way if I eliminate the Keptin.  Apparently he still holds some resentment at the Keptin's treatment of his nephew when he was a fast-track junior officer.

### Plan A:
|        | Hand                                        | value |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------- | ----- |
| Keptin | 10 clubs, 10 diamonds, 11 hearts, 10 spades | 41    |
| Me:    | Jack clubs, 0 diamonds, 2 hearts, 10 spades | 22    |

One of my idiot lesser minions "knows for a fact" that the Keptin keeps a personal stash of exotic weapons in his quarters that could take him out, no problem.  Well, _duh_.  The biggest guns on the ship, right at the heart of the Keptin's completely unassailable defenses!  You don't say?

Maybe the Keptin will simply explode into a lovely cloud of fluttering Caldorian butterflies, while he's at it.  Try again.

### Plan B:

|        | Hand                                          | value |
| ------ | --------------------------------------------- | ----- |
| Keptin | 10 clubs, 11 diamonds, 10 hearts, 10 spades   | 41    |
| Me:    | Jack clubs, 8 diamonds, Jack hearts, 0 spades | 28    |

Okay, I'm thinking about the "big gun in the Keptin's quarters" plan.  Maybe not entirely without merit.  It turns out the Executive Office is intrigued by the opportunities presented by House Pike's business position.  If I could just get that gun out into the open...

### Plan C:

|        | Hand                                        | value |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------- | ----- |
| Keptin | 11 clubs, 10 diamonds, 10 hearts, 10 spades | 41    |
| Me:    | Jack clubs, 7 diamonds, 4 hearts, 9 spades  | 30    |

Getting places.  An old Academy instructor remembers the Keptin as an insolent cadet and would love to see him taken down a notch.  Perhaps we could arrange a "medical emergency" that would draw the Keptin out of his quarters to visit his old "mentor", and then I could sneak in, and .... Hmm.

Nope.  Needs work.

### Plan D:

|        | Hand                                                | value |
| ------ | --------------------------------------------------- | ----- |
| Keptin | 0 clubs, 0 diamonds, 0 hearts, 0 spades             | 0     |
| Me:    | King clubs, King diamonds, King hearts, King spades | 44    |

Total victory!  I swept the field of all the Keptin's guards, resources, money... even his lover.  Everything fell into place so easily.  The Keptin, in his disgrace, tried fleeing the ship in a shuttlecraft.  Easy pickings for our Tactical Officer.  The House of Pike is overjoyed.  Promotions all around!

_Pulled 8 of hearts as new Benefactor_

Flush with recent events, the new Navigation Officer has ideas about how to "improve efficiency among the bridge crew".  I just bet she does.

### Plan A:

|        | Hand                                       | value |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------ | ----- |
| Keptin | 10 clubs, 3 diamonds, 10 hearts, 10 spades | 33    |
| Me:    | 8 clubs, 8 diamonds, 8 hearts, 4 spades    | 28    |

_Needed greater than 5, rolled a 7_

It turns out the Navigation Officer is a quick draw with her standard issue.  The ventilation duct in the Observation Desk is getting a little cluttered.  And kind of icky.  Plus the Executive Officer now has a profitable new client for his business dealings in House Pike.

Did I say "Executive Officer"?  I meant "Keptin".  Turns out there's an opening...

## Commander's Personal Log

_Draws King of Clubs as new Benefactor_

A little bird wearing a Big Hat says that the Emperor approves of my recent career trajectory.  With a little more work, I could be in line for my own command.  Perhaps even a place at court?

### Plan A:

|        | Hand                                         | value |
| ------ | -------------------------------------------- | ----- |
| Keptin | 11 clubs, 10 diamonds, 9 hearts, 10 spades   | 40    |
| Me:    | 11 clubs, 8 diamonds, 0 hearts, Queen spades | 28    |

Apparently the Keptin--our own good former XO--has taken notice of my career trajectory as well.  She is more on her guard than the old Keptin was.  Impossible to get to.  I had an unfortunate malfunction in the Intruder Suppression system all lined up during the Emperor's personal tour of the ship, but couldn't find anyone willing to take the fall.  I mean, assist me with necessary maintainance.  And I'm not about to try "fixing it" myself.  That thing is dangerous.

### Plan B:

|        | Hand                                       | value |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------ | ----- |
| Keptin | 10 clubs, 10 diamonds, 9 hearts, 10 spades | 40    |
| Me:    | 11 clubs, 10 diamonds, 4 hearts, 0 spades  | 24    |

Blast these cowardly crewmates of mine!  Does nobody recognize a fabulous bribe when they see it?  And what good is that moron Academy instructor to me if he's not here on the ship where he can do me the _slightest molecule of good_?

Why does he hate all his students, anyway?

Wait... did I ever turn in my final?

### Plan C:

|        | Hand                                        | value |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------- | ----- |
| Keptin | 10 clubs, 10 diamonds, 10 hearts, 11 spades | 41    |
| Me:    | 11 clubs, Jack diamonds, 0 hearts, 3 spades | 23    |

Cowards and imbiciles.  I'm surrounded by kittens, not crewmates.  Why is everyone so afraid to act?  What are they teaching at Officer School these days?  Even guaranteed promotion isn't the incentive it once was.  I'm going to drown my sorrows in the Mess Hall with some Vegan Mushroom Rum.  The safe batch, I mean.

### Plan D:
|        | Hand                                       | value |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------ | ----- |
| Keptin | 11 clubs, 0 diamonds, 10 hearts, 10 spades | 41    |
| Me:    | 11 clubs, 6 diamonds, 0 hearts, 0 spades   | 23    |

I'm really scraping the bottom of the barrel here.  A trunk full of Denebian Flame Flowers doesn't go as far as it used to.  I doubt those useless waterbags who call themselves "crew" have the guts to even try overthrowing *me*, much less the Keptin.  Might as well throw myself out of the airlock.  I'm the only one holding anything together around here.

### Plan E:

|        | Hand                                                | value |
| ------ | --------------------------------------------------- | ----- |
| Keptin | 0 clubs, 0 diamonds, 0 hearts, 0 spades             | 0     |
| Me:    | King clubs, King diamonds, King hearts, King spades | 44    |

If you want someone dead, you'll have to kill them yourself!  So I did!  MWAHAHAHAHAHAHA!

Nobody even stood in the way, the shiftless lapdogs.  I just pulled everything apart, bit by bit, sneaky sneaky sneaky.  So simple!

Come to think of it, I don't know if I even want the ship now, seeing how feckless and fragile everybody is.

No... No, I want it.  I really, really want it.  I can whip these lumps into shape.  A little discipline will do the crew good.

## Keptin's Personal Log

_Pulled a 9 of Clubs as a bonus Benefactor for having swept the board before_

Ah, plunder.  Is there any sound more delightful than the tinkling of your former enemy's riches as they sift through your hands?  And, oh my: I finally got my hands on that experimental strain of Saggitarian Facemelting Flu.  Remember, the stuff I was going to use way back when I was a wee little Ensign?  History is not without a sense of humor.  With all this in my power, I am invincible!  Nothing can stop me now!

Well, come to think of it, I have been hearing some disturbing rumors.  Could be trouble, but at least somebody's got some guts around here.  I'd better look into it.

### Supplemental Entry #1

|         | Hand                                        | value |
| ------- | ------------------------------------------- | ----- |
| Keptin  | 10 clubs, 10 diamonds, 10 hearts, 10 spades | 40    |
| Ensign: | 0 clubs, 10 diamonds, 10 hearts, 0 spades   | 20    |

Ensign Whats-his-name tried bribing my personal bodyguard with freeing his father from some mining prison somewhere.  Oldest trick in the book.  Fortunately, my man knew where his loyalties really lay, especially after I reminded him of his *other* family members I have stashed away.

Poor old Ensign McWeasel-Traitor couldn't even bring himself to hit me.  Just kept blubbering in my face when Joe and I walked into his quarters.  Have some dignity, man!

It was a mercy to put him down.  Long live the Empire!

### Supplemental Entry #2

My delightful consort has hinted at an especially intimate night tonight.  It's about time he turned his attention back where it belongs, he's been playing around on that stupid shuttlecraft simulator for a week now.  Speaking of which, I'd better go pull him out of there and remind him what's what.  Keptin's got an itch to scratch.

|         | Hand                                       | value |
| ------- | ------------------------------------------ | ----- |
| Keptin  | 10 clubs, 4 diamonds, 11 hearts, 10 spades | 35    |
| Ensign: | 1 clubs, 11 diamonds, 10 hearts, 5 spades  | 27    |

_Ensign needs to roll better than an 8, rolls an 11_

 ## Chief Medical Officer's Log
 Regret to inform Imperial Fleet Command that the Keptin's body was found dead in a ventilation shaft attached to the Recreation Facility.  Cause of death appears to be severe trauma to the torso and head brought about by repeated battery, patterns consistent with bare knuckles and severe kicking.  Investigation to be conducted by Executive Officer upon her assuming the duties of Acting Keptin.
